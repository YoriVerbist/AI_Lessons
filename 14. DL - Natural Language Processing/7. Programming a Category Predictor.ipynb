    "# Programming a Category Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "A Category Predictor is used to predict the category to which a given piece of text belongs.\n",
    "This is frequently used in text classification to categorize text documents. Search engines for example\n",
    "frequently use this tool to order the search results by relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build this predictor, we will use a statistic called *TermFrequency – Inverse\n",
    "Document Frequency (tf-idf)*. We will not get into detail but generally the tf-idf statistic helps us understand how important a given word is to a document in a set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, the Term Frequency (tf) is basically a measure of how frequently each word appears in a given document. It is the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document. Every document has its own term frequency. The second part of the statistic is the Inverse Document Frequency (idf), which is a measure of how unique a word is to this document in the given set of documents."
