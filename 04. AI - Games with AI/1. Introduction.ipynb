These algorithms (based on recursion) consider all possible actions available at this time (a game tree) and then evaluate their future moves based on these options. The goal\n",
    "of the algorithm of course is to find the optimal set of moves that will help it arrive at the final and (most important) winning position. At the end of this lesson you will use the Minimax algorithm to program the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game."
